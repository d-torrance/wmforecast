	* wmforecast.c: fixed bug where window was still drawn with --help or
  	  --version by moving the call to setPreferences earlier;
	  for the benefit of help2man, copyright and author information added
	  to --version, description and bug report information added to --help
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: call help2man during make to automatically
	  build manpage
	* configure.ac: set version 0.2
