	* Makefile.am: use dist_man_MANS instead of adding man_MANS to EXTRA_DIST
	* Makefile.am, wmforecast.desktop: new file, add wmforecast to menus for
	  desktop environements using freedesktop.org desktop entry standards

2014-05-08  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>
	* wmforecast.c (getPreferencesDirectory): new function to get directory
	  of wmforecastrc file
	* wmforecast.c (getPreferencesFilename): now uses getPreferencesDirectory
	* wmforecast.c (savePreferences): now calls mkdir to create the directory
	  containing wmforecastrc; this fixes a bug where the wmforecastrc file
	  was not created when the directory did not exist yet

2014-05-07  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>
	* wmforecast.c (Dockapp): combined with old UpdateData struct to better
	  facilitate new feature:
	* wmforecast.c (editPreferences): new GUI to edit wmforecastrc
	* wmforecast.c (setPreferences): removed check to see if both -w and -z
	  options were used, as it was creating a problem when wmforecastrc
	  existed; new behavior is to just take the last option given
	* wmforecast.c (getWeather): "Location not found" error now uses setError
	  instead of exiting
	* configure.ac: set version 0.4, added PKG_CHECK_MODULES for x11
	* Makefile.am: added x11 libs and flags, manually add WINGs libs and flag,
	  since get-wings-flags returns the deprecated lungif
	* NEWS, README:  updated with version 0.4 info

2014-04-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>
	* wmforecast.c: changed all calls to free to use WINGs's native wfree;
	  removed if statements before calls to free, since wfree already does
	  this
	* wmforecast.c (setError): moved earlier, so that it can be called from
	  setConditions
	* wmforecast.c (setConditions): now returns an error when icon image
	  not found
	* wmforecast.c (updateDockapp): checks to see if na.png will load before
	  using it
	* wmforecast.c (WriteMemoryCallback): removed check to see if result of
	  wrealloc was NULL (wrealloc already does this)
	* ChangeLog: corrected year in all entries (it's not 2015 yet...)
	* NEWS, README: updated with version 0.3 info
	* configure.ac: set version 0.3

	* the following changes took place after the v0.3 release:

	* Makefile.am: wmforecast.1 target now depends on config.h; this will
	  cause manpage to reflect changes in version and bug report email
	* wmforecast.c (setConditions): append a "0" to one-digit codes so that
	  the icon is correctly displayed
	* wmforecast.c (WMGetPLStringForKey): new function to simplify reading
	  values from WMPropLists (inspired by WMGetUDStringForKey), used for
	  the following new feature...
	* wmforecast.c (setPreferences): reads user defined preferences from
	  XDG_CONFIG_DIR/wmforecast/wmforecastrc

2014-04-19  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>
	* switched timer handler from pthread to WING's native WMAddPersistent-
	  TimerHandler and added --interval option, resulting in numerous changes:
	* configure.ac: removed check for pthread
	* wmforecast.c (UpdateData): struct formerly known as ThreadData, added
	  long int minutesLeft (keeps track of the number of minutes until the
	  next refresh)
	* wmforecast.c (updateDockapp): now takes UpdateData struct as argument
	  instead of WMScreen, Dockapp, and Preferences (for passing via timer
	  and event handlers); added "loading" text while downloading new data
	* wmforecast.c (timerHandler): counts down number of minutes until next
	  refresh (needed because WMAddPersistentTimerHandler fails when
	  milliseconds argument too large, e.g., one hour)
	* wmforecast.c (setPreferences): documented --interval option
	* wmforecast.c: changed all calls to malloc and realloc to use WINGs's
	  native wmalloc and wrealloc
	* wmforecast.c (refresh): new function, refreshes weather data when icon
	  double clicked

2014-04-17  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>
	* wmforecast.c: improved error handling -- Weather struct now contains
	  errorFlag and errorText.  If errorFlag set to 1, "ERROR" is displayed
	  in dockapp along along with an icon with a question mark, and
	  errorText is displayed in a balloon tooltip, instead of drawing the
	  dockapp as usual.  Previous calls to libcurl and libxml that used
	  stderr for errors now use this.  This avoids, e.g., a segfault when
	  the internet is down.

2014-04-16  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>
	* wmforecast.c: bugfix -- After downloading the weather, the Weather
	  struct was being freed, but it contained the pointer to the icon
	  currently used by the dockapp, causing a crash.  This has been fixed.
	  In addition, functions have been added to properly free the
	  Forecast and ForecastArray structs inside each Weather struct.
	* README: expanded description

2014-04-15  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* wmforecast.c: fixed bug where window was still drawn with --help or
  	  --version by moving the call to setPreferences earlier;
	  for the benefit of help2man, copyright and author information added
	  to --version, description and bug report information added to --help
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: call help2man during make to automatically
	  build manpagec
	* configure.ac: set version 0.2
