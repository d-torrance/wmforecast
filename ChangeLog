	* wmforecast.c: bugfix -- After downloading the weather, the Weather
	  struct was being freed, but it contained the pointer to the icon
	  currently used by the dockapp, causing a crash.  This has been fixed.
	  In addition, functions have been added to properly free the
	  Forecast and ForecastArray structs inside each Weather struct.
	* wmforecast.c, configure.ac: PACKAGE_BUGREPORT now set to my email
	  address, printed by --help (for the benefit fo help2man)
	* README: expanded description

  	  --version by moving the call to setPreferences earlier;
	  for the benefit of help2man, copyright and author information added
	  to --version, description and bug report information added to --help
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: call help2man during make to automatically
	  build manpage
	* configure.ac: set version 0.2
