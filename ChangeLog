	* wmforecast.c: switched timer handler from pthread to WINGs's native
	  WMAddPersistentTimerHandler; as a result, ThreadData struct renamed
	  UpdateData; updateDockapp now takes UpdateData as an argument
	* configure.ac: removed check for pthread
	* wmforecast.c: changed all calls to malloc and realloc to use WINGs's
	  native wmalloc and wrealloc
	* wmforecast.c (updateDockapp): added "loading" text while downloading
	  new weather data
	* wmforecast.c (refresh, main): new function, refreshes weather data
	  when icon double clicked

	* wmforecast.c: improved error handling -- Weather struct now contains
	  errorFlag and errorText.  If errorFlag set to 1, "ERROR" is displayed
	  in dockapp along along with an icon with a question mark, and
	  errorText is displayed in a balloon tooltip, instead of drawing the
	  dockapp as usual.  Previous calls to libcurl and libxml that used
	  stderr for errors now use this.  This avoids, e.g., a segfault when
	  the internet is down.

	* wmforecast.c: bugfix -- After downloading the weather, the Weather
	  struct was being freed, but it contained the pointer to the icon
	  currently used by the dockapp, causing a crash.  This has been fixed.
	  In addition, functions have been added to properly free the
	  Forecast and ForecastArray structs inside each Weather struct.
	* README: expanded description

	* wmforecast.c: fixed bug where window was still drawn with --help or
  	  --version by moving the call to setPreferences earlier;
	  for the benefit of help2man, copyright and author information added
	  to --version, description and bug report information added to --help
	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: call help2man during make to automatically
	  build manpagec
	* configure.ac: set version 0.2
