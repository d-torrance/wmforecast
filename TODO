* can we get forecasts working again?
* error handling:
  - user enters bad latitude/longitude
* make geoclue optional (e.g., libgeoclue not in trusty)
  - disable button in prefs window if so
* try to deal w/ earlier versions of libgweather
  - e.g., gweather_info_new took 2 arguments until 3.27.4 (3.18.2 in xenial)
