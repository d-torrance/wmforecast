Future wmforecast features:
==========================
* Re-examine code now that I know a little more C.
  - Do the structs all make sense?
  - WMCreateDockapp function -- submit patch to WINGs?
  - Use WMSetApplicationIconWindow?
  - Use tools like valgrind to check things out.
* Make # of days shown in forecast configurable?
  - Possibly include dates if > 7 to avoid confusion.
