Future wmforecast features:
==========================
* Keep track of when data was last retrieved; report in balloon
* Customizable colors (background and text)
  - command line (-b and -t?)
  - GUI (use WINGs color panel)
  - Recreate icons to remove black border.
* Re-examine code now that I know a little more C.
  - Do the structs all make sense?
  - WMCreateDockapp function -- submit patch to WINGs?
  - Use WMSetApplicationIconWindow?
  - Use tools like valgrind to check things out.
  - Run checkpatch.pl.
* Remove dependency on help2man (not really necessary)
  - Remove some of the stuff from -v and -h that I had put
    in specifically for help2man.
  - Speaking of -v, use PACKAGE_STRING for simplicity.
* Rewrite README
  - Spelling error s/field/feel/.
  - "More modern simplicity" sounds kind of elitist
  - XDG_CONFIG_DIR
