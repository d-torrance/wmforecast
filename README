===========================================================

http://wmforecast.sourceforge.net

wmforecast is a weather dockapp for Window Maker using the Yahoo Weather API
(https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)

It is designed to combine the look and field of traditional dockapps, e.g.,
light sea green text on a black background, with a more modern simplicity.
Instead of cramming lots of information in one 64x64 icon, only the current
temperature and an icon representing the conditions are given.  Further
information is available via a balloon tooltip.

Note that wmforecast is written using WINGs, Window Maker's native widget
toolkit.

The icons were designed by MerlinTheRed and are available at
