version 0.9
-----------
* New feature!
  - You may change the background or text colors either using the command line
    (-b or --background for background, -t or --text for text), or by using the
    preferences GUI.
* The configuration file has been moved to the GNUstep Defaults directory
  (likely ~/GNUstep/Defaults/wmforecast -- note this is the same directory as
  the Window Maker configuration files).  You may also store system-wide
  configuration in, e.g., /etc/GNUstep/Defaults/wmforecast.  This move takes
  advantage of several built-in WINGs functions.
